# This is a demonstration of using terminal commands in Python

# Step 0:
# Open your terminal or command prompt and write "python" to eneter the Python interactive shell
# You wil see a prompt like ">>>"
# You can now execute Python commands directly in the terminal
# Step 1: 
# Write "x = 3" in terminal and press enter
# Step 2:
# Write "y = 2" in terminal and press enter
# Step 3:
# Write "print(x + y)" in terminal and press enter

# As you can see python allows you to execute commands in a terminal-like environment


x = 3
y = 2

print(x + y)

# Step 4:
# Exit the Python interactive shell by typing "exit()" or pressing Ctrl+D (or Ctrl+Z on Windows
# Step 5:
# Write "python terminal.py" in terminal and press enter
# This will execute this script and show the output of the print command
