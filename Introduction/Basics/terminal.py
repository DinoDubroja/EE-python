# === Python Terminal Usage Demo ===

# 1. Entering the Python interactive shell
# Open your terminal or command prompt and write "python" to enter the Python interactive shell
# You will see a prompt like ">>>"
# You can now execute Python commands directly in the terminal

# 2. Example commands in the shell
# Step 1: Write "x = 3" in terminal and press enter
# Step 2: Write "y = 2" in terminal and press enter
# Step 3: Write "print(x + y)" in terminal and press enter

# As you can see, Python allows you to execute commands in a terminal-like environment

x = 3
y = 2
print(x + y)

# 3. Exiting the shell and running a script
# Step 4: Exit the Python interactive shell by typing "exit()" or pressing Ctrl+D (or Ctrl+Z on Windows)
# Step 5: Write "python terminal.py" in terminal and press enter
# This will execute this script and show the output of the print command
# Write "python terminal.py" in terminal and press enter
